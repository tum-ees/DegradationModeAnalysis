Dear user of this tool. 
The above shown graphite curves are almost all extracted from literature. 
In case you want to use them, please cite both the publication (which was 
published alongside this tool) as well as the original research paper, where
these OCPs are extracted from. All graphite curves (including Rehm et al., 
except Kuecher et al) were previously published and must be cited accordingly.

Best regards,
Mathias Rehm
