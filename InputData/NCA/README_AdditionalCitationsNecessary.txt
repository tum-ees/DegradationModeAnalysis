Dear user of this tool. 
The above shown NCA curves have been measured within the frame
of an aging study to investigate the aging behaviour of silicon-
graphite. The study will (date of 12.09.2025) be published in the future.
It is thus sufficient to cite the paper which was published alongside
with this tool. Feel free to search for the paper of the aging study as well.

Best regards,
Mathias Rehm
