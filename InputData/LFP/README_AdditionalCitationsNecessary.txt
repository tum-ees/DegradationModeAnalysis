Dear user of this tool: 
The LFP curves shown here are extracted from the literature. 
In case you want to use them, please cite both the publication (which was 
published alongside this tool) as well as the original research paper, where
these OCPs are extracted from; 
Please refer to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2025.236290

In the file names in this folder, lithiation and delithiation of anode and cathode is shown.
For instance, for full-cell charge, choose anode lithiation and cathode delithiation.
This means that the charge/discharge direction, as well as the normalized capacity for the anode, 
have been swapped to match the full cell definition.
The C in the 0C0x terms at the end of the file names denotes a decimal Point. 
Thus, 0C05 means, for example, 0.05C (dis)charge current. 

Best regards,
